Every year in Virginia, 7th grade students take a Standards of Learning (SOL) exam in math that assesses their knowledge of the 7th grade math curriculum. The goal of this study is to develop a regression model that can predict students' SOL score based on different explanatory variables.

---
# Introduction

### Research Question
- How do various factors such as class period, average grades, test averages, and others influence the SOL score?

### Hypotheses
- Students' SOL scores are significantly affected by their average grades, class periods, and other factors.

## Model Selection

**Full Model**

- Included variables: 'class_period', 'ell_level', 'test_averages', 'average_map', 'average_grades', 'ethnicity', 'gender', 'absences', 'tardys', 'ixl_skills_practiced', 'dessa', 'test_averages' * 'class_period'

**Model Selection Process**

- Forward, backward, and stepwise selection methods used.

- All selection processes came to the same results


**Final Model**

- Variables include: 'class_period', 'average_map', 'test_averages', 'ixl_skills_practiced',  and the interaction between 'class_period' and 'test_averages' should be included.

- Model chosen based on lowest AIC, MSE, and the highest Adjusted R-Squares value

---

#### Final Model Output - Interaction

```{r include=FALSE}
full_interaction_model = lm(sol_score ~ class_period + ell_level + test_averages + average_map + average_grades + ethnicity + gender + absences + tardys + ixl_skills_practiced + dessa + class_period*test_averages, data=Data)

stepinteraction = ols_step_both_aic(full_interaction_model)

finalmodel = lm(sol_score ~ class_period + average_map + test_averages + ixl_skills_practiced + class_period*test_averages, data=Data)

summary(finalmodel)
```

**Adjusted R-Squared**: .783 **AIC**: 906.357 **MSE**: 442.982

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(broom)
tidy_model <- tidy(finalmodel)
kable(tidy_model)
```

---

### Model Diagnostics - Normal Probability Plot

- Most data points fall near the 45-degree line, indicating normality.
    
```{r echo=FALSE}
Data$fitted = finalmodel$fitted.values #adding fitted values
Data$residuals = finalmodel$residuals #adding residuals
Data$studres = studres(finalmodel) #adding studentized residuals

# Regular Residuals
ols_plot_resid_qq(finalmodel)

# Studentized Residuals
qqPlot(finalmodel, ylab="Studentized Residuals", xlab="Theoretical Quantiles")
```

---

### Model Diagnostics - Residuals vs. Fitted Values

- There are no discernible patterns here, indicating a constant variance.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Regular Residuals
ols_plot_resid_fit(finalmodel)

# Studentized Residuals
ggplot(data=Data, aes(x=fitted, y=studres))+geom_point()+
  labs(title='Studentized Residuals', y="Studentized Residuals", x="Fitted Values")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color='red')+theme_bw()
```

---

### Model Diagnostics - Multicollinearity (VIF Scores)

- We have VIF values that are greater than 10, we could try centering the data to help with the multicollinearity problem, insead of removing variables.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(olsrr)
knitr::kable(ols_vif_tol(finalmodel))
```

---
## Centering the Data

- Centering the data helped decrease the VIF scores all below 10.

.pull-left[

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Center the average_map variable
Data$average_test_centered <- Data$test_averages - mean(Data$test_averages, na.rm = TRUE)

# Fit the model with the centered interaction term
interaction_model_centered <- lm(sol_score ~ class_period * average_test_centered + average_map + ixl_skills_practiced , data = Data)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(ols_vif_tol(interaction_model_centered))
```
]

---
### New Final Model - Centered Data and Interaction Term

**Adjusted R-Squared**: .7832

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary(interaction_model_centered)

library(broom)
tidy_model <- tidy(interaction_model_centered)
kable(tidy_model)
```

---
### Model Diagnostics - Normal Probability Plot

- Most data points fall near the 45-degree line, indicating normality.

```{r echo=FALSE}
Data$fitted = interaction_model_centered$fitted.values #adding fitted values
Data$residuals = interaction_model_centered$residuals #adding residuals
Data$studres = studres(interaction_model_centered) #adding studentized residuals

# Regular Residuals
ols_plot_resid_qq(interaction_model_centered)

# Studentized Residuals
qqPlot(interaction_model_centered, ylab="Studentized Residuals", xlab="Theoretical Quantiles")
```

---
### Model Diagnostics - Residuals vs. Fitted Values

- There are no discernible patterns here, indicating a constant variance.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Regular Residuals
ols_plot_resid_fit(interaction_model_centered)

# Studentized Residuals
ggplot(data=Data, aes(x=fitted, y=studres))+geom_point()+
  labs(title='Studentized Residuals', y="Studentized Residuals", x="Fitted Values")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color='red')+theme_bw()
```

---
## Model Diagnostics - Leverage and Influence Diagnostics

- No significant outliers or leverage points affecting the model

    + After checking Cook's D chart, DFBETAS, and DFFITS, I removed the leverage points and outliers that were in the model. 
    
    + There were no changes in significance between the model and the reduced model and none of the parameter estimates changes signs.
    
    + This indicates that this model is robust to influential observations.
---

#### Model Diagnostics -  Polynomial Terms
Adding a polynomial term on the average_map variable made the model more complex and didn't help the assumptions at all. It also made the VIF scores worse.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
library(car)
avPlots(interaction_model_centered)
```

### Interpretations - Statistically Significant (< 0.05)

- **Class Period 6** (Estimate: -51.08, p-value: 0.0000912):

    + Interpretation: Students in class period 6 are expected to score about 51.08 points lower on the sol_score compared to those in class period 1, holding all other variables constant. This effect is statistically significant, suggesting a strong negative impact of being in class period 6 on sol_score.

- **Average MAP** (Estimate: 2.07, p-value: 0)

    + Interpretation: For each one-point increase in average_map, the sol_score increases by approximately 2.07 points, holding all other variables constant at their mean values. This effect is highly statistically significant, suggesting a strong positive relationship between average_map and sol_score.

- **Class Period 6 | Test Averages** (Estimate: 2.80, p-value: 0.000205):

    + Interpretation: The interaction term is statistically significant and suggests that for students in class period 6, the relationship between test_averages and sol_score is much stronger than in class period 1. Specifically, for each one-point increase in test_averages (relative to the mean), the sol_score is expected to increase by approximately 2.80 points.
    
---

### Discussions and Limitations

**Limitations**
- A small sample size can limit the power of the statistical tests, increasing the likelihood of Type II errors (failing to detect an effect that is actually present).
- Interactions can be difficult to interpret
-  Limited generalizability reduces the applicability of the model to different populations or settings.

**Improvements**
- Collect more data to improve model robustness.
- Explore additional interaction terms or alternative models.

---

### Conclusion

**Summary**
- Investigated factors affecting SOL scores using linear regression analysis.
- Identified significant variables and interactions affecting student performance.

**Final Takeaways**
- Significant Predictors: The significant predictors include class_period6, average_map, and the interaction between class_period6 and test_averages. These variables have strong influences on sol_score.

- Non-significant Predictors: Other class_periods, test_averages_centered, and ixl_skills_practiced do not have significant impacts in this model, suggesting that their effects might be less consistent or weaker.
